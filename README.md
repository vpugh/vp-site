# Victoria Pugh - Design &amp; Development Consulting

The website for my freelance business. Utilizing Gulp as a taskrunner to build and maintain a website system.

> I've started using Gulp and need to transistion my scss to a more manageable system. I've been inconsistent in my coding and need to do some general cleanup and make everything clean.

This [site](http://victoriapugh.net) will be a continuing work in progress.
