				<h2 class="article--title">Background</h2>
				<p>
					The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization to promote international co-operation after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict.

				<h2 class="article--title">The Brief</h2>
				<p>
					United Nations HQ (NYC) were hosting the 41st Inter-Agency Games, the first time the games were being held in New York City. They wanted to go above and beyond for these games by creating a new look website and matching promotional pieces and signage. The timeline was very short for this project. I had 2 months to go from research/conception to website launch.

				<h2 class="article--title">Research</h2>
				<p>
					The first information I was given was what they didnâ€™t want in a site, all the past Inter-Agency Games websites. They were simple sites that were text heavy and lacking in images. They weren't the most visually appealing sites. I based my research for this project on similar setups, an international game event. My instinct was to investigate the Olympics and World Cups, two of the largest events that fit the criteria and would be the best at showcasing the different aspects of the games to keep in mind.

				<h2 class="article--title">Wireframes &amp; Prototypes</h2>
				<p>
					My role was the design and development of the site, not designing the assets. I wanted to create a layout that would accommodate the colors, logo and any other assets the United Nations designers came up with. There was a quick review process with the Coordination Committee and the United Nations Print Department. After the review I created a live prototype so I could easily update it and everyone on it's progress. This made it easier to get feedback on the final product.

				<h2 class="article--title">Launch & Results</h2>
				<p>
					The new site was successful in bringing more visual elements to the new design while still being full of necessary information. The launch of the site was 4 months before the event, to get everyone on the same page for registration and coordination for the event. After the site launch there were over 44,000 pageviews with a bounce rate of 34% (lower bounce rate is good), an average of 4 pages per session (people viewed at least 4 pages every visit) and for an average duration of about 4 mins.
