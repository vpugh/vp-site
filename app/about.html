			<h3 class="subtitle atiza--bold">Design Services</h3>
			<p class="text-small">
				Design is more than making something look pretty, it's delving deep into what makes your business and/or product tick and how to communicate that to your customer base. 
			</p>
			<p class="text-small">
				This starts, always, with research into you and your product. From there we use the research and work with you to decide what direction you want your branding/company to go. This includes getting into the specifics of your who is your target audience/users and how to best reach them. 
			</p>
			<p class="text-small">
				Then it's a case of providing the best experience for your customers and a product that will grow your company. Not only making a beautiful experience but an easy, intuitive, rememberable one. Something that takes all the information we've obtained into account and puts the user first and foremost in the design.

Otherwise we strive to always use whatever tools are best suited for you and your business. We can let your update your site or if you want us to do that we can. There are many options and we love experimenting, are flexible and open to learning something new.
